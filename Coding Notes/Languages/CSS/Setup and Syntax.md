You can implement css in two ways
as a stylesheet ruleset or as an inline style inside of the html code file

CSS looks intimidating but it is not that bad

Writing CSS directly inside of html: 
you have to make a styles attribute directly after the opening tag 

Inline styles suck 
Use a style tag to declare a styles section if you are going to implement your css inside of your html file
IT MUST BE PLACED INSIDE OF THE HEAD TAG

To link css to html you must use the link element in the html file

it is formatted like this  : 
<link href = "pathtostylesheet.css" rel = "stylesheet">
