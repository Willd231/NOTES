when reading html code, browsers load in the text into default positions which is very boring 
the box model helps design the position of these elements 

from outside to center it goes: 
margin -> border -> padding -> content 

height and width: work as you would expect them to 


Borders: a border is a line that surrounds an element like a frame around a painting 
borders can have a specific width, style, and color

it goes -width-style-color

border radius 
setting this (in pixels) changes the shape of the border, the larger it is the more round it becomes
