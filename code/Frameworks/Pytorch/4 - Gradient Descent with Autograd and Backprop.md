Example of how we optimize our model using automatic gradient computation using the pytorch Autograd pack 

we start by doing thelinear regression toget the loss 
and then we calc the gradients and get the formula 
when we see that this is working we see that we can replace the manually computed gradients with the automatic back alg from pytorch 

After learning all of these we are able to just replace all manual work with work that pytorch can just do for us 

we dont have to worry about the underlying algo we can just use pytorch
