Html is composed of elements

Element = tag + the content in between the opening and closing tag


The body: 
The body is an html element that is very frequently used only content displayed inside of the opening and closing tags can be displayed ie:

<body>
<p>What's up 
</p>
</body>
Elements function in nested hierarchy, pretty self explanatory 
grandparent - parent- child -- sibling  etc..

Headings: 
<h1> -- decrease in size the larger the number
1 - 4 

DIVS - 
div stands for division 
divs are used to divide the page into segments
They don't have a visual representation however they are used the group html elements together to create styles

Attributes
To be able to expand an elements tag we use attributes
they have two components: name and value
a commonly used attribute is the id
we can use ids to help identify elements 

Displaying text
Paragraphs display a plain block of text ie: <p>

Styling Text
The <em> tag will give a italic emphasis 
The <strong> tage will give a bold emphasis

Line breaks 
The spacing between lines of code in html does not affect the positioning of elements in the webpage
to provide spacing you can use the line break ie: <br>
this element is cool because it only needs the starting tag

Unordered Lists: 
you can use the unordered list tag to create a list of items with no order : <ul> 
<ul>
<li> < /li   >
<li> </li   >

</ u l >


Ordered lists 
<ol> 
to create an ordered list of items use the tag above 
It auto puts numbers behind the <li> elements yippee 

Images 
you can input an image using the <img> tag

this tag is convenient because it is a self closing tag
you just have to specify the src attribute which should be set to the image's source 
ie : <img src= "image-location.jpg" />


Image Alts
the alt tag means alternative text 
which is pretty much for sas 

Videos: 
u can use the <video> tag to include videos
just like the image tag u need specify the source using src however you can also use the width and height and controls tags to format the video 
the video tag is not self closing so u have to include a </video> closing tag as well
