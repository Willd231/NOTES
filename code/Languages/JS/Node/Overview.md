What is node js?

javascript is usually used on the frontend

we never used to be able to use it on the backend or server side

Node changes this. 

cant directly run js on a computer because of  how abstracted it is from machine code
but it can run inside of a browser, it is passed through v8 engine inside of browser

this is where node comes into play, node is written in c++ and contains v8 compiler engine, now we can run js inside of computer or server
