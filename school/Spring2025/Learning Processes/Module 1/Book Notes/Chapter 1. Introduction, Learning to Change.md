Change is the only constant -Lucretius 


Overview: 
Topics Covered in biology texts 
The reason for this is that learning is a biological process resulting from evolution 



1.1 Natural selection: 

Nearly everything is always changing. 
Darwin offers an answer to the reason behind this...

Charles Darwin was a successful naturalist who was invited to join the captain of the beagle in order to explore 
He discovered the origin of species blah blah blah 
Gregor Mendel did the genetics test with the pea plants
Things evolve due to Natural selection - Nature is the Breeder 

1.2 Evolved Behavior: 

A reflex is a relationship between a stimulus and a response to the stimulus 
It is basically a relationship between two events 

Reflexes can be present at birth and some occur during development

Modal action Patterns are a series of related acts found in all or nearly all members of a species
These are basically reflexes that have a strong genetic influence and often become activated by an event called a releaser

These differ from reflexes in 3 different ways: 1. They involve the whole organism rather than just a part. 2. They consist of a long series of acts, and 3. They are more variable than reflexes

Ex: Ants follow pheromones 

General behavior traits are the likelihood that due to someone's genes they will be more likely to engage in a certain type of behavior i.e.: aggression, shyness, adventurousness

These are different than MAPs in the sense that a whole number of events can trigger these types of behaviors which is unlike the releaser
Also, generally MAPs are cut and paste usually all the same however not everyone displays aggression in the same way


1.3 The Limits of Natural Selection:
Natural Selection takes generations for any noticeable impact to occur 
When a large change occurs it could happen too fast and the species may just go extinct instead of adapting 

Many may die in result of change because natural selection wants the species to change and survive not the individual 

Mutation - abrupt change in the genetics of something 
Hybridization - cross-breeding of closely related species


1.4 Learning: Evolved Modifiability 

Learning is a change in behavior not an acquisition of something 
the consensus is that learning is when a durable change occurs - but there is no concrete consensus on what durable means and how long that takes to become durable

Behavior is defined as anything measurable a person or other animal does 
things such as heartbeat and blood flow can be measured as behavior because they can be measured
Emotions count as behavior - not thoughts though.

Experience can be defined as a change in our environment - this falls under stimuli. 

Not all changes in behavior count as learning - sometimes they are just by chance. 


1.5 Habituation: An Example of Learning

habituation is the diminished response to a stimuli as a result of its increased frequency

loud noises effect cats less the greater the number of times the cats were exposed to them

1.6 Nature vs. Nurture: 

One of the most important and oldest arguments - can leaders be made or is it just how they are born
