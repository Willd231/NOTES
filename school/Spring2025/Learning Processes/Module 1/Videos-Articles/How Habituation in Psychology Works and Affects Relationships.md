Habituation is getting so used to something that you stop noticing it.

A decreased response to a stimuli after repeated presentations - APA

Ex: Tuning out the TV while you are trying to study; Your neighbor's house has loud noises coming from it, you gradually begin to ignore them.

Use in psychotherapy to help people overcome phobias


Factors that impact habituation: 
Change - alteration in intensity could draw your attention to it even after habituation
Duration - if the stimulus stopped for a long time extinction would likely occur and then when it started up again the habituation would start again
Frequency - if the stimulus is introduced at a variable amount of times
Intensity - intense stimuli leads to much slower habituation sometimes never habituating 

Habituation in Relationships
Habituation can have real-world consequences, including in our social relationships.11 For example, "relationship complacency" is a form of habituation. Here are a few reasons why this can happen:

We get used to the good and the bad: As we grow to know people better, we stop noticing every little thing and become increasingly habituated to both their good and not-so-good qualities.
We overlook some things and get irritated by others: You might grow accustomed to a partner’s habits that you found irritating at first, or even become increasingly annoyed by things that you overlooked initially.
Novelty increases attention in the beginning: In the beginning stages of any relationship, people tend to respond more readily to each other. Every sensation is thrilling because it is new.
Newness eventually wears off: The exciting newness of a relationship does not last forever. Eventually, habituation sets in, and people stop noticing every little thing about their partners.12
Habituation in a relationship is not necessarily a bad thing. The passion that marks the start of a relationship often gives way to something deeper and more lasting—a more meaningful love that is marked by friendship, support, and respect, in addition to passion.

Is Habituation Bad for Relationships?
Habituation in relationships can be problematic when it leads to taking the other person for granted—something that can easily happen in a long-term relationship. Over time, you might start to feel like your partner does not appreciate how you contribute to the relationship. Or maybe it is your partner who feels that they are being overlooked by you.

How to Overcome Habituation in Relationships
Here are some things you can do to bring some of the initial sparks back into your relationship and reverse habituation:

Focus on the positive: Take the time to think about the things you love about your partner. What are the qualities you admire most about this person? What things attracted you the most when you first met?
Practice gratitude: As you spend more and more time around your partner, it can be all too easy to focus on the things about them that you find irritating. If you focus only on these qualities, it can be extremely difficult to remain satisfied and connected. Instead, practice gratitude for the blessings they bring to your life.
Recall the feelings from the start of your relationship: Think about the things that you first noticed and loved about your partner. Consider the things you enjoy doing together as a couple. Taking the time to notice those qualities and reintroduce those activities is a good way to reconnect.
Try something new: Routines and habits can be helpful, but they can also feel stifling. Look for ways to change things up and add a zing of novelty back to your relationship. Try new activities as a couple and explore things together. It can be an interesting way of building a strong connection, as well as a means to see your partner in a new light.
